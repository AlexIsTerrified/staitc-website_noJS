			<h1>Response Options</h1>
			<div class="first">
				<p>The impacts of global climate change in the United States are already being felt and are projected to intensify in the future, especially without further action to reduce climate-related risks. As the impacts of climate change grow, Americans face decisions about how to respond. </p>

			<p>Actions to prepare for and adjust to changing climate conditions—thereby reducing negative impacts or taking advantage of new opportunities—are known as adaptation. The other major category of response options—known as mitigation—involves efforts to reduce the amount and speed of future climate change by limiting emissions or removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Adaptation and mitigation actions are linked in multiple ways and can be considered complementary strategies—mitigation efforts can reduce future risks, while adaptation can minimize the consequences of changes that are already happening as a result of past and present emissions. </p>
			<p>For consistency with IPCC SR1.5, and to show the most robust results across models, the new CAT benchmark pathways follow the approach to derive median and inter-quartile ranges (50% ranges) extracted from the IPCC SR1.5 database for total global greenhouse gas emissions (for those pathways that meet the CDR criteria above).</p>
			<p>The central “1.5°C compatible“ benchmark is defined as the median of pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C, or below, throughout the 21st century with no or limited (<0.1°C) overshoot (for the pathways meet the CDR criteria above). In these pathways global average temperature increases above pre-industrial are limited to below 1.6°C over the 21st century and below 1.5°C by 2100 (typically 1.3°C). “1.5°C compatible“ emissions levels in 2030 are consistent with IPCC SR1.5 SPM (25–30 GtCO2e/year based on SAR GWP) but due to CDR constraints are 1 GtCO2e/year lower for median and 2 GtCO2e/year lower for top end of range.</p>
			<p>The “2°C” compatible benchmark pathways are drawn from the “lower-2°C” and “high-overshoot 1.5°C” pathways in the new set of IAM pathways assessed in IPCC SR1.5. This includes all pathways in the IPCC SR1.5 scenario database that have global average temperature increase held below 2°C above pre-industrial with at least a likely (>66%) probability over the 21st century, excluding pathways that qualify as “1.5°C compatible” as explained above. As above, these pathways are filtered to exclude those that exceed the BECCS and AFOLU sustainability limits identified in the IPCC SR1.5. The final IPCC SR1.5 pathway category of “higher-2°C” is not included at all, as these pathways hold warming below 2°C throughout the 21st century with a probability less than 66% (50–66%).</p>
